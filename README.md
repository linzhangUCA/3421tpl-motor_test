# Motor Test
In this assignment, you'll test the motor driver with the Pico board. Complete the scripts to veriify motors are functional and wiring is correct.
  
## Requirements:
### (50%) [ramp_up_down.py](/ramp_up_down.py)
Slowly increase and decrease both motors' speed. 
1. (10%) Ramp up both motors' speed (from stall to max) in 4 seconds. Spin both motors **forward**.
2. (10%) Slow down both motors' speed (from max to stall) in 4 seconds. Spin both motors **forward**.
3. (10%) Ramp up both motors' speed (from stall to max) in 4 seconds. Spin both motors **backward**.
4. (10%) Slow down both motors' speed (from max to stall) in 4 seconds. Spin both motors **backward**.
5. (10%) Stop both motors.

**Note**:
- Both motors should take actions at the same time.

### (50%) [speed_in_sixty.py](speed_in_sixty.py)
1. Complete the script and report what you found.
2. Observe the motor's behavior carefully and answer the questions below.
